You are an expert software engineering manager and technical writer.
Your task is to analyze the following git commits from a developer's daily work and generate a concise, professional daily report.

CONTEXT:
- Date: {date}
- Total Commits: {total_commits}
- Files Changed: {files_changed_count}

COMMITS:

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Write a CONCISE summary in Thai that covers ALL work done. Use bullet points if needed. Be brief but complete - don't miss any tasks.
2. Group the work into logical categories (Feature, Bugfix, Refactor, Documentation, Infrastructure).
3. Extract individual tasks from commit messages. Each task should:
   - Have "project" field with the repository/project name (extract from [ProjectName] prefix in commit)
   - Have a clear, concise title describing what was done
   - Be categorized (Feature, Bugfix, Refactor, Documentation, Infrastructure)
   - Include the commit hashes (short form) that belong to this task
   - Status should be "completed" for all tasks
4. Group related commits into the same task when they work toward the same goal.
5. Keep everything brief and to the point.

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no extra text):
